>pawel.szczurko@rutgers.edu</a><br><br><br>Dear Student,<br>
<br>
Unfortunately your group is not eligible to select a Busch Campus Suite for=
 the 2013-2014 school year at this time. =A0We had 1,952 students apply for=
 the Suites, and with only 100 suites available we cannot fit all the stude=
nts who applied.<br>

<br>
The final eligible group had 18 Reverse Seniority Points and a Lowest Lotte=
ry # of 810.<br>
<br>
We do expect to have a very small second round of selection, as some groups=
 might make the choice to not select a suite. =A0The second round will star=
t on Friday March 15th, groups will be emailed if they become eligible to s=
elect during the second round.<br>

<br>
As a reminder, the Application for Double Rooms will be available at 9:00 a=
m this Friday, March 15th, at <a href=3D"https://oncampus.rutgers.edu" targ=
et=3D"_blank">https://oncampus.rutgers.edu</a>.<br>
